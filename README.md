## What is OTC Market? {#what-is-otc-market-1}

Over-the-counter (OTC) market is a decentralized marketplace where
financial instruments are traded directly between two parties, without
the use of a central exchange. OTC markets are often used to trade
securities that are not listed on a stock exchange, such as bonds,
derivatives, and foreign exchange.

## How Does OTC Market Work?

In an OTC market, buyers and sellers negotiate the terms of a trade
directly with each other, without the use of a central exchange. This
allows for greater flexibility and customization of trades, but it also
can make it more difficult to find a counterparty for a trade.

OTC markets are typically regulated by government agencies, which set
rules and regulations to ensure that the market is fair and orderly. OTC
markets are also subject to a number of risks, including the risk of
fraud, price manipulation, and market manipulation.
